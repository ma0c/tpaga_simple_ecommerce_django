# Eventually HTML5UP template for Django

A simple abstraction for [Eventually](https://html5up.net/uploads/demos/eventually/) a template by [html5up,net](https://html5up.net/).

To use in django projects extend from [base.html](templates/base.html) which has a following blocks

- title: Title of the page, show in browser title
- static-css: Default theme css
- specific-css: Block to exdend css without alter default behavior
- topbar: Block to have the fixed menu
- content: Main block to put main content
- static-js: Default javascript content
- specific-js: Block to extend js without alter default behavior

We also keep default [index.html](templates.html) file to keep original ideas.
